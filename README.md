# About This Game

This Tic Tac Toe Game is a simple and interactive two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with "X" or "O". The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all nine spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Built for fun and practice, this project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as:

Game logic (win, lose, draw detection)

User input handling

Board rendering

Turn-based gameplay

It can be played in the terminal/console or with a graphical user interface (depending on the implementation).
